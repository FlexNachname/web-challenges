/* The exercise starts here! Sometimes you may need to add a class attribute to some elements in your HTML structure, but otherwise, it won't be necessary to adjust the HTML to solve the tasks. */

/* ------- General Styles ------- */

/* Task 1: First, we want to adjust how the size of our elements is calculated in CSS. Do you know how to switch from "content-box" to "border-box"? */

/* Your solution */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* Task 2: Let's work on some basic stylings that we want to apply to all elements in your code via inheritance. Which selector do we need for this? */

/* Add selector -> body */
body {
  font-family: monospace;
  font-size: 1rem;
  line-height: 1.5;
  background-color: LemonChiffon;
}

/* ------- Headings Part 1 ------- */

/* Task 3: Setting the line height to 1.5 is good for texts, for accessibility reasons, but it seems too much for headings. Let's change this by giving our headings a line height of 1.2. */

/* Your solution h1, h2, h3 etc bekommen festgelegte grÃ¶ÃŸe */
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  line-height: 1.2;
}

.title {
  /* Your solution */
  background-color: white;
  /* - Change the background color to white */
  margin-top: 0;
  /* - Set the top margin to "0" */
  padding: 10px;
  /* - Add padding of 10px */
  text-align: center;
  /* - Center the text of the heading */
}

/* ------- Sections ------- */

section {
  background-color: white;
  /* - Set a white background for our sections */
  padding: 20px;
  /* - Add padding of 20px and margin of 10px */
  margin: 10px;
  /* - Add padding of 20px and margin of 10px */
  border-left: 5px solid orange;
  /* - A fancy add on: Add a solid 5px border with the color "orange" that is only visible 
  on the left. Hint: Use "border-left". :) */
}

section:nth-of-type(2) {
  /* Your solution -> border-left-color: gold */
  border-left-color: gold;
}

/* ------- Headings Part 2 ------- */

/* Task 6: The headings of our sections somehow look boring. Therefore, we want to change this:

- Add a border to the left and the right of the title only. The border should be 3px solid with the color "gold".
- There should be some space between the text and the border.
- The right border should end with the last character of the title. Hint: If you don't know how to do this, think about the display property.
- Bonus: The border color of the "Favorite PokÃ©mon" title should be "orange". Hint: You may need another CSS rule.
*/

.subtitle.favorite {
  /* Your solution */
  border-left-color: orange;
  border-right-color: orange;
}

/* ------- List ------- */

/* Task 7: Finally, let's style our list with of favorite PokÃ©mon. Which selector do we need? Also, add values for padding. */

/* Add selector */
ul li {
  list-style: "ðŸ§¡";
  padding-left: 10px /* Add value -> added value 10px */;
}

/* ------- The End -------- */

.image-fluid {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}

/* Note: After finishing all tasks, this class should also work. The image should adjust its size flexibly according to the width of the viewport. */
